        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <img src="cloud-computing-companies.png" alt="" id="image-right">
        <!-- Give 10 benefits and description of Cloud Computnig using the ul list you can search how the element works -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>Faster time to market</b></li>
            <p>You can spin up new instances or retire them in seconds, allowing developers to accelerate development
                with quick deployments. Cloud computing supports new innovations by making it easy to test new ideas and
                design new applications without hardware limitations or slow procurement processes.</p>
            <li><b>Scalability and flexibility</b></li>
            <p>Cloud computing gives your business more flexibility. You can quickly scale resources and storage up to
                meet business demands without having to invest in physical infrastructure.
                Companies don’t need to pay for or build the infrastructure needed to support their highest load levels.
                Likewise, they can quickly scale down if resources aren’t being used.</p>
            <li><b>Cost savings</b></li>
            <p>Whatever cloud service model you choose, you only pay for the resources you actually use. This helps you
                avoid overbuilding and overprovisioning your data center and gives your IT teams back valuable time to
                focus on more strategic work. </p>
            <li><b>Better collaboration</b></li>
            <p>Cloud storage enables you to make data available anywhere you are, anytime you need it. Instead of being
                tied to a location or specific device, people can access data from anywhere in the world from any
                device—as
                long as they have an internet connection.</p>
            <li><b>Advanced security</b></li>
            <p>Despite popular perceptions, cloud computing can actually strengthen your security posture because of the
                depth and breadth of security features, automatic maintenance, and centralized management.
                Reputable cloud providers also hire top security experts and employ the most advanced solutions,
                providing more robust protection. </p>
            <li><b>Data loss prevention</b></li>
            <p>Cloud providers offer backup and disaster recovery features. Storing data in the cloud rather than
                locally can help prevent data loss in the event of an emergency, such as hardware malfunction, malicious
                threats, or even simple user error.</p>
            <li><b>Competitive edge</b></li>
            <p>Cloud takes care of various business aspects, such as maintaining the IT infrastructure, licensing
                software, or training personnel to manage your data. It, therefore, gives you an edge over your
                competitors since
                the time and resources you invest are minimal. </p>
            <li><b>Sustainability</b></li>
            <p>Given the current state of the environment, it's no longer enough for organizations to place a recycling
                bin in the breakroom and claim that they're doing their part to help the planet. Real sustainability
                requires solutions that address wastefulness at every level of a business. Hosting on the cloud is more
                environmentally friendly and results in less of a carbon footprint.</p>
            <li><b>Disaster Recovery</b></li>
            <p>One of the factors that contributes to the success of a business is control. Unfortunately, no matter how
                in control your organization may be when it comes to its own processes, there will always be things that
                are completely out of your control, and in today's market, even a small amount of unproductive downtime
                can
                have a resoundingly negative effect. Downtime in your services leads to lost productivity, revenue, and
                brand
                reputation.</p>
            <li><b>Insight</b></li>
            <p>Many cloud-based storage solutions offer integrated cloud analytics for a bird's-eye view of your data.
                With your information stored in the cloud, you can easily implement tracking mechanisms and build
                customized reports to analyze information organization wide. From those insights, you can increase
                efficiencies and build action plans to meet organizational goals.</p>

    <div class="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <img src="cloud.png" alt="" id="image-left">
        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Excellent Accessibility</b></li>
        <p>Access to information stored in the cloud is made possible. Users can access their data from anywhere in the
            world with an internet connection, making remote work, flexibility, and effective operations possible.</p>
        <li><b>Cost-effective Maintenance</b></li>
        <p>Organizations using cloud computing can save money on both hardware and software upkeep. Because cloud
            service providers manage the maintenance and updates, businesses no longer need to make costly
            infrastructure investments or set aside resources for continuous maintenance.</p>
        <li><b>Upkeep and Updates</b></li>
        <p>Cloud service providers take care of infrastructure upkeep, security patches, and updates, freeing
            organizations from having to handle these duties themselves.
            This frees up IT teams' time and resources to work on higher-value projects like application development,
            data analysis, or strategic initiatives rather than wasting them on rote upkeep and updates.</p>
        <li><b>Pay-per-use Model</b></li>
        <p>Cloud computing uses a pay-per-use business model that enables companies to only pay for the services they
            really utilize. This method is affordable, eliminates the need for up-front investments, and offers budget
            management flexibility for IT.</p>
        <li><b>Agility and Innovation</b></li>
        <p>Businesses can continue to be innovative and nimble thanks to cloud computing. Organizations may quickly
            embrace new solutions, test out emerging trends, and promote corporate growth with access to a variety of
            cloud-based tools, services, and technology.</p>
    </ul>
    <div class="disdvantages">
        <h2>Disdvantages</h2>
        <img src="cloud-computing.jpg" alt="" id="image-right">
        <!-- Give 5 Disadvantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ul>
            <li><b>Vendor Reliability and Downtime</b></li>
            <p>Because of technological difficulties, maintenance needs, or even cyberattacks, cloud service providers
                can face outages or downtime. Users may not be able to access their data or applications during these
                times, which can interfere with business operations and productivity.</p>
            <li><b>Internet Dependency</b></li>
            <p>A dependable and fast internet connection is essential for cloud computing. Business operations may be
                delayed or interrupted if there are connectivity problems or interruptions in the internet service that
                affect access to cloud services and data.</p>
            <li><b>Limited Control and Customization</b></li>
            <p>Using standardized services and platforms offered by the cloud service provider is a common part of cloud
                computing. As a result, organizations may have less ability to customize and control their
                infrastructure, applications, and security measures. It may be difficult for some organizations to
                modify cloud services to precisely match their needs if they have special requirements or compliance
                requirements.</p>
            <li><b>Hidden Costs and Pricing Models</b></li>
            <p>Although pay-as-you-go models and lower upfront costs make cloud computing more affordable, businesses
                should be wary of hidden charges. Data transfer fees, additional storage costs, fees for specialized
                support or technical assistance, and expenses related to regulatory compliance are a few examples.</p>
            <li><b>Dependency on Service Provider/b></li>
            <p>When an organization depends on a cloud service provider, it is dependent on that provider's
                dependability, financial security, and longevity. Users may have disruptions and difficulties switching
                to alternate options if the provider runs into financial difficulties, changes their pricing policy, or
                even closes down their services.</p>
        </ul>
